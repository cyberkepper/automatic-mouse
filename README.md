## Overview

**Automatic Mouse Mover for Linux** is a lightweight, open-source application designed to keep your computer active by simulating mouse movements. It prevents your system from entering an idle state, which is especially useful for avoiding "away" status on applications like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other similar productivity tools.

## Features

- **Automatic Mouse Movement**: Keeps your computer active by simulating mouse movements at regular intervals.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the frequency and pattern of mouse movements according to your needs.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Minimal system resource usage ensures smooth performance.
- **Linux Exclusive**: Specifically designed and optimized for Linux environments.

## How It Works

The application periodically moves the mouse pointer slightly to simulate user activity. This prevents the system from triggering idle status, which is especially useful for remote workers who need to appear active on communication and productivity platforms.
